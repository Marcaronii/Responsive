      <p class="justified">Smoke now has the ability to interact with other gameplay events, creating new opportunities. Bullets and HE grenades can push smoke to briefly clear sightlines or expand occlusion.</p>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="Image/cs.png" alt="Gameplay 2" class="docimg" />
      <H4>Expands to fill spaces naturally</H4>
      <p class="justified">Now the smoke will seep out of opened doorways and broken windows, go down and up stairs, as well as expand in long corridors and combine with other smokes.</p>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="Image/cs.png" alt="Gameplay 3" class="docimg" />
      <H4>Reacts to Lighting</H4>
      <p class="justified">In Counter-Strike 2 smoke particles work with the unified lighting system allowing for more realistic light and color.</p>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="Image/cs.png" alt="Gameplay 4" class="docimg" />
      <H4>Gameplay Visuals</H4>
      <p class="justified">In Counter-Strike 2 the most critical gameplay visuals have been redesigned with readability in mind. Bullet impacts can be easily viewed at a distance, and directional blood impacts (that fade over time) give you more information as you move through the world.</p>
